      "We know that we can keep related pieces of information together in C/C++ by putting them into a structure, using the struct keyword. This improves cohesion. There is, however, another way that C++ lets you improve cohesion that cannot be done in C; we can also put functions inside of a structure. This lets us keep related data and functions (now called operations or methods or member functions) in the same data structure, which is called a class. (We'll see the C++ class keyword shortly, in The class Keyword. For now, we're just going to use the struct keyword since it provides similar functionality.) A class is a type. An instance of a class is called an object.\n",
      "Let's take a look at an example:\n",
      "File: student.h Explanation #ifndef _STUDENT_H_ #define _STUDENT_H_ struct Student { int assns, mt, final; float grade(); }; #endif Here we can see that the Student class has three data elds used to hold marks respectively for assignments (assns), the midterm (mt), and the nal exam (final). It has a single method, grade, that takes no parameters and returns the nal grade in the course. In general, we want to try and avoid giving the client/user too much information about our class and its functionality, which is one of the reasons we only give the function signature in the header le. Ideally, we'd give the client our header le and the student.o le, which they could then link in with their code, and they'd never need to know how the nal course grade was actually calculated! File: student.cc Explanation #include \"student.h\" Note that in the implementation le for the Student, we\n",
      "float Student::grade() { return assns * 0.4 + mt * 0.2 + final * 0.4; } have to use the scope resolution operator ::, prexed by the class name, to specify that the grade function is a method of the Student class. (We've seen this used before to specify that something was part of the std namespace (std::). Here we're using it to specify that for some class C, f is in the context of C, by specifying C::f.) Since grade is part of Student, and Student is a type, these elds don't actually exist until we create an instance of Student. So, to what elds is grade referring? It uses the elds of the object that invokes it using operator., as in s.grade() in the client code. Here, grade is being invoked on the object s, so it uses the elds of s in its calculation. File: main.cc client code Explanation #include \"student.h\" #include <iostream> int main() { Student s{ 60, 70, 80 }; std::cout << s.grade() << std::endl; } The client includes our header le, and creates an object s of the Student class type. It initializes s by passing in three integer values to the initialization list delimited by the curly braces ({}). (By default, the compiler maps the values to the data elds in the order they were declared, i.e., the 60 gets stored in assns, the 70 gets stored in mt, and the 80 gets stored in final.) It then calls the grade method on the object s, and outputs the calculated nal grade.\n",
      "Note that the method call is being applied to a specic instance of the class. If I create another student and call grade on it, as in:\n",
      "Student mohammad{ 80, 76, 98 }; mohammad.grade();\n",
      "then grade is using the data elds of mohammad. More formally, all class methods have a hidden, extra rst parameter called this that is a pointer of the class type. The parameter this is always set to contain the address of the object upon which the method is being invoked. So, in the previous example, the value of this inside of grade is the address of mohammad. When you access a class eld within a class method, it automatically uses this, so we could have written the implementation of grade as:\n",
      "float Student::grade() { return this->assns * 0.4 + this->mt * 0.2 + this->final * 0.4; }\n",
      "In practice, this implementation is identical to the one provided in the table above.

In particular, some people really dislike it when programmers use this-> unnecessarily and feel it should only ever be used when it is needed to disambiguate parameter or method calls since they feel it clutters up the code; otherwise, its use should be avoided.\n",
      "In this course, we're going to ask you to only use it when absolutely necessary.\n",
      "Initializing objects\n",
      "Our previous Student example used an initialization list to copy the data values into the object's data elds.\n",
      "Student s{ 60, 70, 80 };\n",
      "This is rather limited in functionality, since it only copies the given data. We also have no way of guaranteeing that any Student object is actually initialized, and that all of the grades are in the range 0 to 100.\n",
      "It would be a lot more useful if we had a method that could be used to guarantee that a Student object was always initialized upon creation, and that all of the grades were in the correct value range. It turns out that C++ classes have a special type of method, called a constructor, used exactly for this purpose. The general format of the constructor (often abbreviated to ctor) is:\n",
      "Notes: Name-of-Class-Type( parameter-list ) { // necessary code } There is no return type, since you're building the actual object. The constructor does not return the object it builds. The method name is the type name. The parameter list may be empty. Constructors can be overloaded! The method body may be empty, but must be present.\n",
      "When separated into header and implementation les, our Student example becomes:\n",
      "Header le: student.h Implementation le: student.cc\n",
      "#ifndef _STUDENT_H_ #define _STUDENT_H_ #include \"student.h\" struct Student { int assns, mt, final; Student( int assns, int mt, int final ); float grade(); }; #endif int capGrade( int grade ) { if ( grade < 0 ) return 0; if ( grade > 100 ) return 100; return grade; } Student::Student( int assns, int mt, int final ) { this->assns = capGrade( assns ); this->mt = capGrade( mt ); this->final = capGrade( final ); } float Student::grade() { return assns * 0.4 + mt * 0.2 + final * 0.4; }\n",
      "You'll notice that we used the this-> notation in the body of our constructor. We had to use it there since our parameter names are the same as our data eld names.\n",
      "If I don't use this, the compiler assumes that I want to use the local parameters, and will assign them to themselves, i.e., assns to assns, mt to mt, and final to final. This leaves my data elds uninitialized (or at least, not initialized with the values I want). The same problem occurs if you initialize local variables rather than the object's data elds.\n",
      "What happens if we try to create a student object without using the constructor, e.g., Student s;? (See the code in lectures/c++/06-classes/01-constructors/student_v2.)\n",
      "From before, we know that if we create a student object and didn't have a constructor as in the example below:\n",
      "Student s{ 60, 70, 80 };\n",
      "the compiler used the values in braces to initialize the student's data elds. With a constructor, the same syntax calls the constructor and passes the values in as the method's parameters. It turns out that I can also initialize an object in C++ using the assignment operator, operator=, as in:\n",
      "Student s = Student{ 60, 70, 80 }; int x = 5; std::string word = \"hello\";\n",
      "And in some circumstances, I can use ( ) to initialize variables, especially when invoking constructors. For example:\n",
      "Student s( 60, 70, 80 ); int x( 5 ); std::string word( \"hello\" );\n",
      "The rules in C++ as to when we can use = and when we can use () are rather arbitrary. C++ now has uniform initialization syntax using {}, which is meant to be used in nearly all initialization situations.\n",
      "Try to get into the habit of using uniform initialization syntax. It is the preferred syntax in modern C++ and will work more consistently, more often than the other forms.\n",
      "Our initialization code thus becomes:\n",
      "Student s{ 60, 70, 80 }; int x{ 5 }; std::string word{ \"hello\" }; Node * ptr = new Node{ 10, nullptr };\n",
      "Since we can overload methods in our classes, this means that we can overload our constructors. It then becomes possible to use default parameters on our constructors. (Note that these only go on in the interface, and not on the implementation!) So, our constructor in lectures/c++/06-classes/01-constructors/student_v3 becomes:\n",
      "struct Student { int assns, mt, final; Student( int assns = 0, int mt = 0, int final = 0 ); float grade(); };\n",
      "and our implementation doesn't need to change! This way, at the beginning of the term, we can create students who don't have any marks, or who have just the assignments grade, or the assignments and midterm, or all three grades.\n",
      "Student s1{ 60, 70, 80 }, s2, s3{60}, s4{60, 70};\n",

      "1. Allows default parameters.\n",

Since grade is part of Student, and Student is a type, these elds don't actually exist until we create an instance of Student. So, to what elds is grade referring? It uses the elds of the object that invokes it using operator., as in s.grade() in the client code. Here, grade is being invoked on the object s, so it uses the elds of s in its calculation. File: main.cc client code Explanation #include \"student.h\" #include <iostream> int main() { Student s{ 60, 70, 80 }; std::cout << s.grade() << std::endl; } The client includes our header le, and creates an object s of the Student class type. It initializes s by passing in three integer values to the initialization list delimited by the curly braces ({}). (By default, the compiler maps the values to the data elds in the order they were declared, i.e., the 60 gets stored in assns, the 70 gets stored in mt, and the 80 gets stored in final.)
